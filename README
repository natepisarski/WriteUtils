WriteUtils are small programs which I often incorporate in my Haskell code to handle IO. They write to files in varying ways.

append:
   Appends all of the command line arguments onto one line.

put:
   Overwrites the entire file and puts the arguments line-by-line in it.

stack:
   Appends arguments to a file, one on each line.
